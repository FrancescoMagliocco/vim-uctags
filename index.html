<div class="main">
  <p>Vim-UCTags is a <a id="vim">Vim</a> plugin that utilizes <a id="ctags">
  Universal-Ctags</a> in such a way to make highlighting syntax more accurate by
  using the tags generated.  This is done efficiently where a <a id="synFiles">
  Syn File</a> is created for every file that has an associated tag, rather than
  creating one massive Syn File and sourcing it.  Creating one massive Syn File
  and sourcing it can cause severe performance issues in Vim, even when doing
  something as simple as just moving the cursor; furthermore, even powerful
  PC's can face performance issues from massive Syn Files being sourced.  For
  accuracy, Vim-UCTags also recognizes <a id="incDir">include directives</a> for
  a select few languages (More are to be supported as development continues).
  An include directive that has an available <a id="incFile">include file</a>
  and <a id="incSynFile"> include Syn File</a> highlight only tags that are
  present in a <a id="srcFile">source file</a>.  If an include Syn File has tags
  that a source file doesn't, those tags will be ignored; why try to highlight
  something that isn't there.</p>
